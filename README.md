## Introduction

This project leverages a deep neural network model to classify the gender of penguins. By using features such as species, bill length, bill depth, and flipper length, the model aims to accurately determine whether a penguin is male or female.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of measurements of various penguin species. The dataset includes the following features:
- Species
- Bill length (mm)
- Bill depth (mm)
- Flipper length (mm)

## Model

The deep neural network model is implemented using the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Normalize the features to enhance model performance.
2. **Model Architecture:** Configure a simple neural network with input, hidden, and output layers.
3. **Training:** Use backpropagation and optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam) to minimize the loss function.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy.

## Installation

To run the project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SegunDada/penguin-classification-dnn.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd penguin-classification-dnn
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To classify the gender of a penguin using the trained deep neural network model:

1. Ensure the dataset is in the root directory.
2. Run the classification script:
    ```bash
    python classify_penguin.py --data_path data/penguin_data.csv --model_path models/your_model.h5
    ```
3. The output will display the predicted gender of the penguins in the dataset.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 74.63% on the test dataset. Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the main juypter notebook file.
